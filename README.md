# 🚀 Production-Grade Kubernetes on Bare Metal

A comprehensive, learning-focused Kubernetes project designed to take you from "What is a Pod?" to running a production-grade microservice stack on bare-metal hardware.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project simulates a real-world production environment with multiple layers of networking, storage, and observability.

## 📂 Project Structure: The "What" and "Why"

Understanding why a file exists is just as important as knowing what it does. Here is the breakdown:

### 1. Cluster Infrastructure (`/cluster`)
*   **What**: `kubeadm-config.yaml` and `calico.yaml`.
*   **Why**: This is the foundation. `kubeadm` bootstraps the cluster, and `Calico` (a Container Network Interface - CNI) creates the virtual network that allows Pods to talk to each other.

### 2. Networking (`/networking`)
*   **`/metallb`**: Kubernetes doesn't have a built-in LoadBalancer for bare metal. MetalLB fixes this by assigning real IPs from your home/office network to your services.
*   **`/ingress-controller`**: Instead of having a different IP for every service, NGINX acts as a gateway (an Ingress Controller) so you can use hostnames like `api.example.com`.
*   **`/network-policy`**: In production, security is key. These files act as a "Firewall" inside Kubernetes, blocking unauthorized traffic between services.

### 3. Application Services (`/services`)
*   **`user-service`** & **`product-service`**: These are Node.js microservices. Each contains:
    *   `app/`: The actual code.
    *   `Dockerfile`: Instructions to turn the code into a "Container Image".
    *   `k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests (Deployments to run pods, Services to make them reachable, and HPA for auto-scaling).

### 4. Database (`/database`)
*   **What**: MongoDB defined as a **StatefulSet**.
*   **Why**: Unlike microservices, databases need "memory". A StatefulSet ensures that if a database pod restarts, it stays connected to the same storage and name, so your data isn't lost.

### 5. Observability Stack (`/elk`)
*   **Filebeat**: A small agent running on every node to "watch" the log files from your apps.
*   **Logstash**: A heavy-lifter that takes raw logs, cleans them up, and labels them.
*   **Elasticsearch**: The database for your logs.
*   **Kibana**: The web interface where you search and visualize logs.

## 🛠️ Kubernetes Manifests: A Beginner's "Rosetta Stone"

In the `k8s/` folders throughout this project, you will see several types of YAML files. Here is what they are and why we use them:

| File Type | Purpose | Real-world Analogy |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **`deployment.yaml`** | Defines how many copies (replicas) of your app should run and which container image to use. It handles "Rolling Updates" automatically. | **The Manager**: Ensures the right number of workers are always on the shift. |
| **`service.yaml`** | Provides a stable "Internal IP" and DNS name for your pods. Since pods can die and restart with new IPs, the Service is the constant address. | **The Receptionist**: You call the receptionist, and they connect you to whoever is currently available. |
| **`configmap.yaml`** | Stores non-sensitive configuration like port numbers or environment names (`NODE_ENV=production`). | **The Instruction Manual**: Tells the app how to behave in different environments. |
| **`secret.yaml`** | Stores sensitive data like database passwords or API keys, encoded in base64. | **The Vault**: Keeps the keys safe and only gives them to authorized containers. |
| **`statefulset.yaml`** | Like a Deployment, but for apps that need to save data (like MongoDB). It gives pods a "sticky" identity (e.g., `mongodb-0`). | **The Assigned Desk**: Unlike a hot-desk (Deployment), the worker always has the same desk and drawer. |
| **`hpa.yaml`** | The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. It watches CPU/Memory usage and adds more pods if the app is under heavy load. | **The Elastic Band**: Stretches (adds pods) when pulled and shrinks when the tension is gone. |

## 🧪 Testing Locally
If you don't have bare-metal servers yet, you can test this entire stack on your laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) using `kind`.
👉 **[Local Testing Guide](docs/local-testing.md)**

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
*   **Machines**: 2-3 Ubuntu 22.04 nodes (Real hardware or VMs).
*   **RAM**: At least 4-8GB per node is recommended for the full ELK stack.
*   **Knowledge**: Basic terminal usage. We'll handle the K8s parts!
